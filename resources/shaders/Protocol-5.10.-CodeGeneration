Talking about Interfaces
-------------------------

Data:
	- Source Code as files
	- Load Data
	- Crawler

Preprocessing PP:
	PP output
	- Text (Source code as it is) 
	- AST
	Methods
	- Extracting and flattening AST
	- Normalization
	- Serialization

NN-Module:
	- RNN
	- Attention
	- OGNN
	- ...

Task:
	- Generates one token
	- ..

Config:
	Data -> source code files
	Poepr -> text
	NN -> RNN
	Task -> pred.on

Homework:
+ define interfaces and moduls
+ small presentation
+ what design patterns weve found
+ code patterns/ problems.
